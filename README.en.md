## I. License Information

The project scripts are based on:
1. Python environment @ PSFL license <br>
2. Pyomo platform @ BSD license <br>
3. Pypower library @ BSD license <br>
4. Ipopt library @ EPL license <br>
<br>
<br>


## II. Function Introduction

By parsing the integrated IEEE cases in [Pypower](https://github.com/rwl/PYPOWER/tree/master), the system parameters are obtained. Based on the [Pyomo](https://www.pyomo.org/documentation) framework, the economic optimum (minimum network loss) of IEEE test systems is implemented. The power system load flow calculation method is [AC-OPF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwNL2SuEaI&t=1238s&ab_channel=GurobiOptimization), and the solver for solving the optimization problem is the interior-point solver [IPOPT](https://pypi.org/project/ipopt/).<br>
<br>
<br>

## III. Usage Instructions

The project includes multiple test cases, and the scripts can be run directly.
1. IEEE 9-node system<br>
2. IEEE 118-node system<br>
3. IEEE 300-node system<br>
<br>
